DFHack tool tags
================

A tool often has at least one tag per group, encompassing when you use the tool,
why you might want to use it, and what kind of thing you're trying to affect.

See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hiDlo8M_bB_1jE-5HRs2RrrA_VZ4cRu9VXaTctX_nwk/edit#gid=1774645373
for the tag assignment spreadsheet.

"when" tags
-----------
- `adventure-tag-index`: Tools that are useful while in adventure mode. Note that some tools only tagged with "fort" might also work in adventure mode, but not always in expected ways. Feel free to experiment, though!
- `dfhack-tag-index`: Tools that you use to run DFHack commands or interact with the DFHack library. This tag also includes tools that help you manage the DF game itself (e.g. settings, saving, etc.)
