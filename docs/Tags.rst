DFHack tool tags
================

A tool often has at least one tag per group, encompassing when you use the tool,
why you might want to use it, and what kind of thing you're trying to affect.

"when" tags
-----------
- `tag/adventure`: Tools that are useful while in adventure mode. Note that some tools only tagged with "fort" might also work in adventure mode, but not always in expected ways. Feel free to experiment, though!
