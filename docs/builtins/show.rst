:index:`Unhides the DFHack terminal window.
<show; Unhides the DFHack terminal window.>` Useful if you have hidden the
terminal with `hide` and you want it back. Since the terminal window won't be
available to run this command, you'll need to use it from a `keybinding` set
beforehand or the in-game `command-prompt`.

Only available on Windows.
