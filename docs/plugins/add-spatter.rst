<add-spatter; Make tagged reactions produce contaminants.>` Give some use to all
those poisons that can be bought from caravans! The plugin automatically enables
itself when you load a world with reactions that include names starting with
``SPATTER_ADD_``. These reactions will then produce contaminants on items
instead of improvements. The contaminants are immune to being washed away by
water or destroyed by `clean`.
