add-spatter
===========

Make tagged reactions produce contaminants. The plugin is intended to give some
use to all those poisons that can be bought from caravans. It automatically
enables itself when you load a world with reactions that include names starting
with ``SPATTER_ADD_``. These reactions will then produce contaminants on items
instead of improvements. The contaminants are immune to being washed away by
water or destroyed by `clean`.
