    :summary: Make tagged reactions produce contaminants.

    :no-command:

Give some use to all those poisons that can be bought from caravans! The plugin
automatically enables itself when you load a world with reactions that include
names starting with ``SPATTER_ADD_``, so there are no commands to run to use it.
These reactions will then produce contaminants on items instead of improvements.
The contaminants are immune to being washed away by water or destroyed by
`clean`.
