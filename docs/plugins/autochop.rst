Auto-harvest trees when low on stockpiled logs. This plugin can designate trees
for chopping when your stocks are low on logs.

Usage::

    enable autochop

Then, open the settings menu with :kbd:`c` from the designations menu (the
option appears when you have "Chop Down Trees" selected with :kbd:`d`-:kbd:`t`).

Set your desired thresholds and enable autochopping with :kbd:`a`.

You can also restrict autochopping to specific burrows. Highlight a burrow name
with the Up/Down arrow keys and hit :kbd:`Enter` to mark it as the autochop
burrrow.

Autochop checks your stock of logs and designates trees once every in game day.
