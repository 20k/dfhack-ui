This plugin periodically scans your stocks of rough gems and creates manager
orders for cutting them at a Jeweler's Workshop.

Usage:

``enable autogems``
    Enables the plugin and starts autocutting gems according to its
    configuration.
``autogems-reload``
    :index:`Reloads the autogems configuration file.
    <autogems-reload; Reloads the autogems configuration file.>` You might need
    to do this if you have manually modified the contents while the game is
    running.

Run `gui/autogems` for a configuration UI, or access the ``Auto Cut Gems``
option from the Current Workshop Orders screen (:kbd:`o`-:kbd:`W`).
