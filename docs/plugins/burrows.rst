Auto-expand burrows as you dig. When a wall inside a burrow with a name ending
in ``+`` is dug out, the burrow will be extended to newly-revealed adjacent
walls. Note that digging 1-wide corridors with the miner inside the burrow is
SLOW.

Usage::

    enable burrows
    burrows enable auto-grow

Both of the above commands need to be run for the auto-grow functionality to
work. See the `burrow` command for more burrow-related tools.
