<confirm; Adds confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.>` Now you can get
the chance to avoid seizing goods from traders or deleting a hauling route in
case you hit the key accidentally.

Usage:

- ``enable confirm``, ``confirm enable all``
    Enable all confirmation options. Replace with ``disable`` to disable all.
- ``confirm enable option1 [option2...]``
    Enable (or ``disable``) specific confirmation dialogs.

When run without parameters, ``confirm`` will report which confirmation dialogs
are currently enabled.
