**Tags:** `tag/fort`, `tag/auto`, `tag/animals`

Protect fertile eggs incubating in a nestbox. This plugin will automatically
scan for and forbid fertile eggs incubating in a nestbox so that dwarves won't
come to collect them for eating. The eggs will hatch normally, even when
forbidden.

Usage::

    enable nestboxes
