Tools
=====

DFHack commands, plugins, and scripts are grouped by tags to make it easier to
find groups of related tools.

.. note::
    In order to avoid user confusion, as a matter of policy all GUI tools
    display the word :guilabel:`DFHack` on the screen somewhere while active.

    When that is not appropriate because they merely add keybinding hints to
    existing DF screens, they deliberately use red instead of green for the key.
